# snake-game-using-python
I create a snake game that are in feature phone.
Features
Snake Movement: The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys.

Food Generation: Food pellets appear at random locations on the screen. When the snake eats a food pellet, it grows longer, and the player earns points.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score. There's also a high score feature that persists even after closing the game.

Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the snake and the walls or its own body. If a collision occurs, the game ends, and the player's score is reset.

How to Play
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed.
Run the main.py file to start the game.
Control the snake using the arrow keys.
Eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's body.

main.py: The main Python script that initializes the game and controls the game loop.
snake.py: Contains the Snake class, which manages the snake's behavior.
food.py: Defines the Food class responsible for generating food pellets.
scoreboard.py: Implements the ScoreBoard class to track and display the player's score.
